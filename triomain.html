<h2>2018 - Moving On</h2>

<p>The people pictured here are friends of mineâ€”they used to be my neighbors. Sadly for me, they moved to another neighborhood. I sort of helped them move. As I was helping them, I noticed a bunch of blank/half-used wooden panels
lying about. I was admiring them, and one of my friends told me that I could have them! It was very generous, and I hadn't really done a photorealistic painting in 9 years, so I was very excited.
To thank them, I made them the subject of the first panel, which was quite large. I intentionally tried to include as many pesky objects in the pictures (of which there were plenty to choose from since their stuff was everywhere)
to challenge myself because I hate painting objects</p> <p>Once finished, I carried the damn thing to their new apartment, where it now hangs.</p>
