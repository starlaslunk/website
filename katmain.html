<h2>2018 - Katya</h2>

<p>There's no great story around this one. I told my friend Katya that I'd like to paint her (it came off as more of a threat). Weeks went by. Then, we were sitting at the Flowers Cafe (for all you Brooklynites!)
and the lighting was so perfect I took a picture then-and-there and worked from it. It's currently sitting behind my bookshelf since she didn't want a picture of herself hanging on her own wall (understandable) and I have
no wall space in my place lol. Still, it was a good exercise.</p>
