<h2>2010 - Thesis Show Paintings</h2>
<a target="_blank" href="images/thesis.jpg"><img class="four_wrap" src="images/thesis.jpg" alt="Thesis Paintings" ></a>
<p>These paintings were completed for my thesis, "Tales from the Third Place Environment." I was 22 and it was OK considering. I stand by it, anyway. I think these paintings are still back in Los Angeles somewhere... and they'd
be the last paintings I'd make for another 7 years...</p>
<p>The guy on the left I used to work with at Starbucks. That's Dan, who worked on the comic "Chinese Restaurant" with me. On the right is Josue, who went to CalArts with me. We also went to a lot of shows together and were pretty close for a while.
We lost touch over time.</p>
