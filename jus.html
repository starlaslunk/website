<h2>House of D Poster</h2>
<a target="_blank" href="images/jus.jpeg"><img class="four_wrap" src="images/jus.jpeg" alt="House of D" ></a>
<p>I made this poster to commemorate the Women's House of Detention which used to be located right next to the Jefferson Market Library in the West Village. The "House of D" as it was known by those who were held there,
was a towering Art-Deco behemoth that dominated the skyline for decades. Angela Davis and Andrea Dworkin (pictured in the drawing) were held there, and their testimony against the conditions there helped close
the prison in the 70s. Athena is pictured in the center due to her role as the one who lays down the law in Aeschylus' Eumenides.</p>
